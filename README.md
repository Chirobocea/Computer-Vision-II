Welcome to this repository showcasing my individual journey through the Computer Vision II course at the University of Bucharest, in collaboration with industry leader Arnia. These notebooks reflect my dedicated efforts in tackling a diverse range of topics, commencing with foundational LeNet implementations and progressing to advanced techniques such as image classification, bounding box regression, and semantic segmentation across diverse datasets.

Within each notebook, I meticulously address optimization strategies, adeptly incorporate augmentation techniques, and strategically apply transfer learning principles to elevate model performance. The repository also highlights my personal touch, evident in architectural refinements that illustrate my evolution as I continually enhance designs to achieve superior results.

Embark on a guided tour through my learning journey, witnessing my hands-on exploration of cutting-edge practices that underpin the realm of computer vision. This repository not only showcases my skills but also captures my unwavering commitment to mastering the art of visual intelligence.
